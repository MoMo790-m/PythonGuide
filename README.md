# Python Tutorial

Hey everyone,  

In this repo, I've put together summaries of some great books that really helped me understand Python on a deeper level. The two books I highly recommend are:  

- **Data Structures and Algorithms in Python**  
- **Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes**  

Both of these books gave me a super clear and in-depth understanding of Python, and honestly, I had a lot of fun going through them.  

### Why did I summarize these books?  
One of my favorite ways to study is by explaining things to myself. After every video or book chapter, I like to break things down in my own words—it helps me process the information better. I also enjoy writing down my thoughts, and for that, **Jupyter Notebook** has been a game-changer. It helped me organize my notes in a clean and structured way, which made me really happy.  

I haven’t summarized everything yet—some topics and chapters are still left, but I’ll be adding them soon. I hope you find this repo and these summaries helpful.

### Stay Organized  
To keep things simple and easy to follow, I'll organize the files and topics properly so you don't get lost.  

#### 1. Data Types  
Start with the basics:  
- `Python_Tutorial_Data_Type(Numbers).ipynb`  
- `Python_Tutorial_Data_Type(String).ipynb`  

#### 2. Lists  
Next, get comfortable with lists:  
- `List_In_Python1.ipynb`  
- `List_In_Python2.ipynb`  
- `List_in_Python3.ipynb`  
- `List_In_Python4.ipynb`  
- `List_In_Python5(With_Loop).ipynb`  
- `Numerical_Lists_In_Python.ipynb`  
- `Slicing_a_List(Part_1).ipynb`  
- `Slicing_a_List(Part_2).ipynb`  

#### 3. Tuples  
Understand how tuples work:  
- `Tuple.ipynb`  

#### 4. Conditional Statements  
Finally, learn how to control the flow of your programs:  
- `Pre_Intro_To_if_Statement.ipynb`

Hope this helped, even just a little!  

Oh, and before I forget—make sure you actually **practice and write the code yourself**. That’s the best way to learn!  

If you’re looking for good platforms to sharpen your skills, I’d recommend:  
- **LeetCode** – Great for coding challenges.  
- **StrataScratch** – Awesome for SQL and data science problems.  
- **Codeforces** – A bit advanced, but good for competitive programming.  
- **DataCamp** – Interactive learning for data science.  
- **HackerRank** – Good for general coding and problem-solving.  

That’s it! Just don’t forget to **enjoy the process, make progress, and have fun along the way.**
